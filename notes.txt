The Handshake

0 C-- || S--  #The Handshake describes the process of Establishing a Connection between the Client and the Server
1 CHI || S--  #CHI = Client Handshake Innit   - Client initiates conversation 
2 C-- || SHI  #SHI = Server Handshake Innit   - Server begins the synchronisiation process
3 C-- || SDH  #SDH = Server Diffie-Hellman    - Server Begins the Diffie-Hellman exhcnage by sending its private key
4 CDH || S--  #CDH = Client Diffie-Hellman    - Client responds to the SDH by sending its wond private key
5 C-- || SCC  #SCC = Server Crypto Check      - Server sends encrypted message with the newly generated hash from Diffie-Hellman \
5                                             TODO Contents of the message, Maybe a math problem
6 CCC || S-- #CCC = Client Crypto Check       - Client responds to the encrypted message \
6                                             TODO Contents of the message
7 C-- || SHF #SHF = Server Handshake Finalize - Server ends the synchronisiation process
//Connection is Established//

The Heartbeat

0 C-- || S-- #The Heartbeat describes the process of keeping the connection active \
0             if the Server doesn't recieve a Heartbeat every ${TTL} seconds the connection is Terminated
1 CHB || S-- #CHB = Client Heart Beat         - Client sends Heartbeat packages to renew its connection TTL
2 C-- || SUU #SUU = Server Understands U      - Server Understands the Heartbeat, ACK equivalent
//Connection is Renewed//

The Client Initiated Connection Termination(CICT)

0 C-- || S-- #The CICT describes the process of Termination of the Connection by the Client
1 CGB || S-- #CGB = Client Good Bye           - The Client initiates the Connection Termination
2 C-- || SGB #SGB = Server Good Bye           - Server Understands the Good Bye, ACK equivalent
3 CFL || S-- #CFL = Client Flat Line          - Client end the Connection
//Connection is Terminated//

The Server Initiated Connection Terminated(SICT)

0 C-- || S-- #The SICT describes the process of Terminated of the Connection by the Client \
0             This only occures if the Server does not recieve a Heartbeat on time
1 C-- || SFL #SFL = Server Flat Line          - The Server immediately Terminates the Connection without the need for a Response \
1                                             TODO Evaluate if this can not be exploited
//connection is Terminated//
